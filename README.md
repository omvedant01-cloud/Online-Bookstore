## Description
The Online Book Store Database Project by Om Vedant is a structured SQL-based system designed to manage book inventory, customer information, and order processing. The database consists of three core entities: 

 **Books:** Stores details such as title, author, genre, publication year,
 price, and stock availability.

 **Customers:** Maintains customer records including name, email,
 phone, city, and country.
 
 **Orders:** Tracks purchase transactions with order dates, quantities,
 and total amounts, linked to both customers and books.
 
 Through the use of SQL queries, joins, constraints, and aggregate
 functions, the project ensures efficient data storage, retrieval, and
 analysis. It provides insights into sales performance, customer
 behavior, and inventory management, simulating the core
 functionalities of a real-world online bookstore.
